<h1 id="Providence-:-General-purpose-command-and-control-panel">Providence : General-purpose command and control panel
</h1>
<p>A five years ago, my phone and laptop was stolen when I sleep at home. The accident 
happend at morning when I still sleeping and the perpretator sneak to my room without 
I notice. I go to internet cafe and all tracing effort have fail me at that time. 
I use find my device and got nothing.
</p>
<p>After a couple year pass, this issue still buging my head and the data that I wasn't 
able recover. A day when I do some random internet surfing, I bump into <a href="https://github.com/lolsecs/LolSec/blob/master/Botnet%20Bible.pdf">Botnet Bible</a>
book by Tyson Hedge. 
</p>
<p>Since the book born from hacker capitalist pit (HackForums), that book 
focused on creating botnet and doing malware mass campaign that we are not go 
to talk about. 
</p>
<p>The concept of robot network or botnet is amaze me. It will do good 
countermeasure if my device go stoled, a DIY anti-theft mechanism, so 
creating <a href="https://github.com/glatika/providence">Providence</a> and I hope could see benefit of using Botnet 
in good terms like surveiling your own devices. 
</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Command-and-Control-(C2)-?">What is Command and Control (C2) ?
</h2>
<div class="mendoza-center">
    <img src="/img/c2-architecture.png"/>
</div><p>A C2 works like this, a devices will requesting command (beaconing) to 
C2 server where we put command as bot operator then the C2 will give response
a command that your devices need to execute.
</p>
<p>C2 is a infrastucture (program + server) used to communicate with your devices remotely for 
maintaining access. C2 itself work in client-server architecture, mean there a C2 server and 
C2 client (implant) - C2 client in this context is your devices. 
</p>
<p>The C2 server is a server the used to supply command to devices and C2 client is a program 
that beaconing to C2 server to request and execute command that supplied. C2 client supposed
to running in device you want to access.
</p>
<p>Providence is C2 server only, which mean you need implement C2 client by your own. Maybe in 
future I will provide example of client.
</p>
<h2 id="What-the-general-purposeness-in-Providence-?">What the general-purposeness in Providence ?
</h2>
<p>C2 widely known for it malicious intent, thats why <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0011/">ATT&amp;CK MITRE</a> become good
references for detecting C2 presence. C2 could be use for command base for
 botnet army, control center in cyberwarfare, and much more.
</p>
<p>This not mean C2 does not have good purpose in it existential mean. There are 
example to C2 used for good purpose, like parental app control, biling system
at internet cafe, remote access tool and many other.
</p>
<p>Base example above you could choose what intention C2 client you want implement, Providence 
 works as message broker and report panel. The general purposed of Providence is
 adaptable of C2 to be match with client design that provide way to communicate 
 with operator, client-centric C2 server.
</p>
<div class="mendoza-center">
    <img src="/img/providence-poc.png"/>
</div><p>In simple way, you just design the program you want then connect it with Providence.
Providence recently only support gRPC, because it schema design so you just 
generate client code and use it in your program. 
</p>
<p>Futher, I will add HTTP/S support and adding some new communitcation channel 
for open opportunity to advance feature like file transaction or data streaming.
</p>
<h2 id="Why-there-3-modes-to-run-Providence-?">Why there 3 modes to run Providence ?
</h2>
<p>The main reason is scalability, you could have many proxy mode instance 
for load balancing and run single panel mode instance to conect to one of the 
proxy and set command.
</p>
<p>The full mode intented if you want run full-spectrum of Providence in one-go, 
like in local network or else.
