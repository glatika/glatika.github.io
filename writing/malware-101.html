<h1 id="Malware-101-:-What-is,-How-it-evade,-spread-and-avoid-it-from-your-system.">Malware 101 : What is, How it evade, spread and avoid it from your system. 
</h1>
<p>The transformation how computer programming from connecting bunch of wires into stored 
instuction set - called stored programe, in machine have reducing cost and simplify workflow to operate computer. We can 
installed Firefox browser without plug bunch of cables to install it -
 except network cable if you use wired internet. This
opportunity unlock another side of computation, a malcious one.
</p>
<p>Malware already exist since antiquity - era of stored program. A program could do simple instruction that cause a 
computer unuseable, a script ability to spread accross computer network then make IT infrastructure paralyzed, 
even nowadays it become medium of cyber espionage, digital extortion and geopolitical propaganda.
</p>
<h2 id="So,-what-is-malware-actually-?">So, what is malware actually ?
</h2>
<p>Malware or malcious software, a computer software that behave for 
doing harm to its user, system and possibly machine. This is an umberella term 
, Malware have a number of categories defined by it goal and technical speciality. 
</p>
<p>Worm is one of malware family that goal to replicate to every computer it can access,
mass spreading.
</p>
<p>Backdoor yet another malware that goal provide access to the operator. The access could 
vary from accessing remote terminal illegitimatelly, stole sensitive credential and being an 
intial access to compromise your network. 
</p>
<p>By contrast, Backdoor usually aiming individual or institution that targeted rather mass 
indiscriminate target like worm. Tha 2 example above are malware family that popular.
</p>
<p>There various family that I not mention like virus, bootkit, ransomware, spyware and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-malware#office-ContentAreaHeadingTemplate-hazsarj">many more</a>.
</p>
<h2 id="How-malware-works-?">How malware works ?
</h2>
<p>Malware no much different with ordinary software in techincal landscape, 
it own process and depend in operating system. 
</p>
<p>The differnt of malware is  
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Own evasion technique of being identified by security program.</li>
    <li>Attempting to be out of control from computer user and persist against user will.</li>
    <li>Feature of malicious intent, such stealing data or unwanted remote access.</li>
</ul><p>TL;DR: Malware is software that introduce unwanted hostility to computer system.
</p>
<h2 id="How-a-malware-difficult-to-detect-?">How a malware difficult to detect ?
</h2>
<p>Alongside it malicious feature, both Backdoor or Worm. Malware have a  
weapon against computer defense, such anti-virus, to keep persist in computer 
system by being undetected. 
This type of behaivior to increase success rate prior feature execution.
</p>
<p>There a various method that malware use to remain elusive:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>AntiX feature</li>
    <li>Executable protector/Crypter</li>
    <li>Evasive execution</li>
    <li>Multi-stage delivery</li>
</ul><h3 id="Anti-X-feature">Anti X feature 
</h3>
<p>Imagine you create a function in your program that detect presence of Antivirus is enable.
If the function return true, the program do not execute malware function, or sophisticated
version it could disable antivirus. This is what mentality of Anti X feature, to detect and evade 
from antivirus presence. 
</p>
<p>What X stand for then? The X is variable, you could change it to AV for Anti Anti Virus, Sandbox, VM
or Debuging for prevent your program debugged.
</p>
<h3 id="Executable-Protector-/-Crypter">Executable Protector / Crypter 
</h3>
<p>Lets imagine again, your program executable as treasure your excavated from undersea then you want to hide it content 
from any chance to getting stolen. What you should do ? Hide it so it look like not treasure.
</p>
<p>Executable protector use to encrypt and obfuscate the malware to hide it content from static analysis from security program,
 after that it will packed together with stub that works to decrypt, then it will run the decrypting process to extract the 
 malware executable and execute it on fly.
</p>
<p>Keep in mind, executable protector is not just for malware. There many legit software company is using it to 
protect propiertary function in their program from prying eyes.
</p>
<h3 id="Evasive-Execution">Evasive Execution
</h3>
<p>Lets imagine, your own 4 slice pizza but there a note that tell you there are one pizza 
 slice contain a poison in it, but it all look identical.
</p>
<p>Evasive execution is the art of program execution that blending in with operating system environment, 
such how a malware can running by opening a doc files (Maldocs) or run as another program 
(known as Process Hollowing). 
 
</p>
<p>This are broad and exetensivly part of malware development, that dealing with process and operating 
system syscall to elaborate malcious program execution.
</p>
<h3 id="Multi-stage-delivery">Multi-stage delivery 
</h3>
<p>Lets imagine, you today are trying to pay fine because violate trafic law.
So, you come to the police office to deal with it, but the officer ask you 
to department A to submit the files then after try to submit you asked to go 
 for verification at department B then all done.
</p>
<p>This kind of redirection, depicting how multi-phase delivery works. Malware delivery 
is another way of obfuscation. 
</p>
<p>The malware consist of 2 component, dropper and the malware itself. The dropper job is download 
actual malware and executed when it consider secure (read Anti X feature). 
</p>
<p>When the AV scan for the dropper it clear, because it not contain the actual malware code.
</p>
<p>This example call 2-stage delivery. the limit of this stage is only in the imagination of 
the malware developer.
</p>
<h2 id="How-malware-spread-?">How malware spread ?
</h2>
<p>Malware could not spread itself after it compiled, 
there a technique that use in malware campaign to reach 
you .
</p>
<h3 id="Spear-Phising">Spear-Phising
</h3>
<p>This most commonly used technique in cybercrime both attack targeted entity or mass spread. 
The phising consisted of email attachmed that contain malware or a scam offer that ask user 
to install a program.
</p>
<p>The another novel implementation of this technique is typosquatting filename in WhatsApp 
attachment that contain a stealer, a malware focused in stealing data and credential, 
then grab all victim credential.
</p>
<h3 id="Infected/Polluted-file">Infected/Polluted file 
</h3>
<p>This method work by putting malware payload embbeded with legit executable file or putting malware 
as component of the legit file. 
</p>
<p>This method usually spotted in warez distribution such cracked games, pirated software, keygen and movie 
with another attachment such readme or thumbnail with typosquatting the filename extension.
</p>
<h3 id="Malvertising">Malvertising
</h3>
<p>When you open an URL address then show an unwanted popup ads come from website you open that 
download a file that could possibly malware, usually without you intention to clicking a link.
</p>
<p>Or, a popup that giving you an alert (with noisy alert and text-to-speech) about your computer 
or phone are infected with malware then asking you to download they antivirus -- which is possibly 
the antivirus is the malware itself.
</p>
<h3 id="Propagated-from-compromised-computer">Propagated from compromised computer
</h3>
<p>This method of malware that use exploit to leverage it lateral movement to infect a network and 
could work automously. The example of famous attack is wannacry that use EternalBlue as it exploit 
to infect another computer.
</p>
<h3 id="Direct-Cyberattack">Direct Cyberattack
</h3>
<p>This quite self-explanatory. The malware itself is planted by attacker to gaining foothold in your computer
for further cyberattack. This method indicator of your network already compromised by cyber criminal.
</p>
<h2 id="How-to-tell-a-file-is-malware-or-not-?">How to tell a file is malware or not ?
</h2>
<p>Ok, the whole text I have wrote seem fearmongering about malware is undetectable and nothing you can do.
That completely wrong, you can do thing to known a file is malware or not and take an action against it.
</p>
<h3 id="Careful-with-file-in-your-computer-and-from-Internet.">Careful with file in your computer and from Internet.
</h3>
<p>Keeping a file organize is important, it help you manage where file you store and also 
 providing extra awareness about file that suspicious or not.
</p>
<p>When you download a file from Internet, do not skip warning about malicious file 
from browser and make sure it have same signature as official stated if any.
</p>
<p>Do not execute program from source your can not trust or obscure and make sure 
before click download button is provide real link proceed - there a lot download button 
click-bait in file sharing site.
</p>
<h3 id="If-it-suspicious,-then-do-a-scan">If it suspicious, then do a scan
</h3>
<p>Windows already provided with defender, but we need to double check it.
So, you have to scan with window defender or you could use online scan such: 
</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload">VirusTotal</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://antiscan.me">AntiScanMe</a></li>
</ol><p>Reminder, DO NOT scan sensitive data since what you upload there are visible to public.
</p>
<p>If its detected as malware, delete it. 
</p>
<p>If the file detected as malware but you want to keep for a reason, 
change the extension to make it not executable to prevent accidentally you run it
then put it inside zip archive with password.
</p>
<p>Sometime, antivirus could do false-positive and do not disable windows defender
 except you understand what actually you do.
</p>
<h3 id="Install-Antivirus-or-any-security-software-to-ensure-safety.">Install Antivirus or any security software to ensure safety.
</h3>
<p>As we know, installing extra security software kind hurdle for performance but 
that extra price to be more secure. There are open source AV and it lightweight, 
<a href="https://www.clamav.net">ClamAV</a>.
</p>
<h3 id="Keep-your-operating-system-updated">Keep your operating system updated
</h3>
<p>Self-explanatory, even Windows update kinda annoying.
</p>
<h3 id="Learn-about-recent-cyber-attack-event">Learn about recent cyber attack event
</h3>
<p>History is best teacher, the way you able to detect and have intution about 
what threat intelligence especially how attacker utilize malware as part of their
Techinque, Tactic and Procedure (TTP).
</p>
<p>The recommendation I could give is reading report about cybersecurity event 
from security vendor, read a book related to it or paper about malware.
</p>
<p>Here the list of references:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://www.mandiant.com/resources/reports">Mandiant's Threat Intelligent</a></li>

</ol><h3 id="(Optional)-Learn-to-develop-a-malware">(Optional) Learn to develop a malware
</h3>
<p>This seem counterintuitive to defend against a malware you should learn to create a malware.
Creating malware will giving you understanding how it environment is crucial both doing malice
 and defending from it.
</p>
<p>The understanding of malware help you to recognize how it operate and learn how to outsmart it.
For this part, I let you figure itself and remember programming is required especially C++ or C#.
</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion
</h2>
<p>What I provide here is based from my way to paranoid about a file inside my computer and 
various reference I gather to learn more depth about application security.
